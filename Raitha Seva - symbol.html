                    Raitha seva is the epitome of entrepreneurial zeal. Our journey began with the start of the cashew factory, followed by rice processing and now producing cattle feed. We are one of the best in the fields that we are in.

Situated at Kanyana, Hebri  - a picturesque place amidst the greenery of the foothills of western ghats, gives us the unique opportunity to produce &amp; process nature's products.

Our never ending quest for best quality always is what has made us market leaders today.
